# iCoder-Tech-Blog-UI-Using-Bootstrap-4
ust built my first responsive tech blog interface â€“ iCoder!  This frontend project is designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4. It's a multipage blog layout including a dynamic navbar, carousel, cards, and modal-based login/signup features. The project helped me strengthen my layout, component, and responsive design skills.
